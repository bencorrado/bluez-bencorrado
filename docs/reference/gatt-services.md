# Connect with LE devices

In this example we want to connect with a LE device and explore its
provided GATT services. The uses LE device in this example provides
a number of vendor specific GATT services but also the standard
battery GATT service.

First, connect with the discovered LE device

```
[bluetooth]# connect 5C:31:3E:71:0C:E7
Attempting to connect to 5C:31:3E:71:0C:E7
[CHG] Device 5C:31:3E:71:0C:E7 Connected: yes
Connection successful
```

As soon as BlueZ has discovered which GATT services are available the
bluetoothctl utility will print out these

```

```

It is now possible to select specific characteristics and read their values or
if possible also write them. This example focuses on the battery level
characteristic from the battery GATT service.

```
[5C-31-3E-71-0C-E7]# select-attribute /org/bluez/hci0/dev_5C_31_3E_71_0C_E7/service0029/char002a
[X4-LIFE Xmarty 2.0:/service0029/char002a]# read
Attempting to read /org/bluez/hci0/dev_5C_31_3E_71_0C_E7/service0029/char002a
[CHG] Attribute /org/bluez/hci0/dev_5C_31_3E_71_0C_E7/service0029/char002a Value: 0x49
  49
```

It is possible also to receive notifications when the value of a characteristic
changes

```
[X4-LIFE Xmarty 2.0:/service0029/char002a]# notify on
[CHG] Attribute /org/bluez/hci0/dev_5C_31_3E_71_0C_E7/service0029/char002a Notifying: yes
Notify started
```

This will now notify whenever the value of the selected characteristic changes.
